Description: PACKAGE: The package will recall two main function.
             The first one, 'Convert', return the graph and will create a list of points.
             The second one,'Orientation', is correlated to the first one as it will create a
             data-frame listing weapons class based on the sum of point from the 
             list created before.    
             Additionally the package contains the data-sets used and loaded directly in the 
             functions mentioned before and that cand be loaded directly from the user.    
             The first data-set, the 'points_army' data-set a data frame with 26 rows and 6 columns contianing 
             several results from 5 type of exercises and the point gained from obtaining that resultb  for 
             each category. Example: Having a result between 2.80 and 2.85 in jumping will give you 24 points.
             The 'Performances' data-set, a data frame with 19 rows and 2 columns, is about the minimum
             points needd to reach a specific weapon class. Example: If after completing your exercises
             the sum of the results is 50, it means you can enter all the army class equals or below 
             that requirement points, that in this case correspond to "Driver".
             SHINY: The package will also recall a shiny app regarding "Performance Scoreboard 
             for Recruitment" with the 'militaryapp()' function.
             The app was built by group E and by inserting the result of some 
             phisical exercises, will give you a possible weapon class of belonging.
             The app is entirely in English with video in French regarding the 
             exercises to do.
